Design review notes from Team 1 members Chris Kane-Pardy and Caleb Monti;
__PDS__
Q: How are you going to test at 60 miles?
A: We are going to do our best using the test system (Marx generator) to see what kind of range we have. Not a must.

Q: Is external power 120V from wall?
A: External power will be USB

__SCHEMATIC__
  __POWER BLOCK__
  Q: What power supply are you using
  A: Boost converter for sub 5V inputs

  __RF INPUT__
  Q: What is J3?
  A: Test Header/Manufacturer provided Eval board connection

  Q: Is J2 for antenna?
  A: any RF input device, likely antenna

  __MAIN BOARD__
  Q: Why is PDS uC listed as STM32?
  A: Change was made and PDS not updated; will fix

  Q: Are unused pins NCs?
  A: They will be yes

  Q: What bus used for transceiver?
  A: SPI

  Q: Are there any test points on the PCB for J4?
  A: Plan on using solder holes as test points

  Comment: Should put NCs on all floating pins

__PCB__

  Q: Will we label pins on PCB or just trust PICO pinout?
  A: PICO pinout is labeled

  Comment: Should add silkscreen for labeling on various pinouts

  Comment: J3 pinout missing a trace

  Comment: Some traces may be a bit close together; most close traces are low frequency. Will try to separate if possible

  Comment: SILKSCREEN AGAIN! - result of designing for EPL PCB. 

  Q: How do we plan on mounting?
  A: We should add mounting holes!

  Comment: Need to add traces for Display even if we don't use it.
